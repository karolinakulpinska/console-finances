# Financial Analysis

## Description

In this challenge, I used my newfound JavaScript skills to complete the required activity. I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses as well as instructions to complete the challenge. I had 
My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset;
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period;
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period;
  * Track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the **average**;
  * Round the average to the nearest 100th;
* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period;
* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period;
* The final code should print the analysis to the console.

I used variables to store data and arithmetic comparisons to perform calculations. Before tackling this task I used pseudocode to structure the required steps. Lastly I logged all the data to the console in the browser as per challenge requirements. 
During the process of building this application I had to do a lot of research to find solutions and use computational thinking to recognise recurring patterns.

I've also made sure that the application:
* loads with no errors;
* is deployed at live URL;
* resembles the example functionality provided in the challenge instructions.

As well as repository:
* follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions;
* follows best practices for variable naming conventions, indentation, quality commentary, etc;
* contains multiple descriptive commit messages, contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

## Resulting analysis should look similar to the following
```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
